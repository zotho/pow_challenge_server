I prefer dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery - Thomas Jefferson
Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God
No freeman shall ever be debarred the use of arms
I cannot live without books; but fewer will suffice where amusement, and not use, is the only future object
I find friendship to be like wine, raw when new, ripened with age, the true old manâ€™s milk, & restorative cordial
... architecture is my delight, and putting up, and pulling down, one of my favourite amusements
And our own dear Monticello ... How sublime to look down into the workhouse of nature, to see her clouds, hail, snow, rain, thunder, all fabricated at our feet!
